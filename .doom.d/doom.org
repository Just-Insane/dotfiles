#+title: Doom Emacs Configuration
#+author: Jax Gauthier
#+email: jax@gauthier.id

This is my Doom Emacs configuration. From this org file, all the necessary Doom Emacs config files are generated.

This file is written in [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config][literate programming style]] using [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. See [[file:init.el][init.el]], [[file:packages.el][packages.el]] and [[file:config.el][config.el]] for the generated files.

* References

Significant reference is made from [[https://zzamboni.org/post/my-doom-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/#tasks-and-agenda][Diego Zamboni]]'s literate config.

* Doom config file overview

Doom Emacs uses three config files:

- =init.el= defines which of the existing Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#modules][modules]] are loaded. A Doom module is a bundle of packages, configuration and commands, organized into a unit that can be toggled easily from this file.
- =packages.el= defines which [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#package-management][packages]] should be installed, beyond those that are installed and loaded as part of the enabled modules.
- =config.el= contains all [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configuring-doom][custom configuration]] and code.

All the config files are generated from this Org files, to try and make its meaning as clear as possible. All =package!= declarations are written to =packages.el=, all other LISP code is written to =config.el=.

** Config file headers

Start by defining the standard headers used by the three files. These headers come from the initial files generated by =doom install=, and contain either some Emacs-LISP
relevant indicators like =lexical-binding=, or instructions about the contents of the file.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or

;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at
;; https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/dot-doom/-/blob/master/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;;(package! another-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;;(package! this-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")

;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;;(unpin! t)

;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at
;; https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/dot-doom/-/blob/master/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!

;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
;; (setq user-full-name "John Doe"
;;      user-mail-address "john@doe.com")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
;; (setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

** Customized variables

Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configure][does not recommend the Emacs =customize= mechanism]]:

#+begin_quote
/Note: do not use M-x customize or the customize API in general. Doom is designed to be configured programmatically from your config.el, which can conflict with Customizeâ€™s way of modifying variables./
#+end_quote

All necessary settings are therefore set by hand as part of this configuration file. The only exceptions are "safe variable" and "safe theme" settings, which are automatically saved by Emacs in =custom.el=, but this is OK as they don't conflict with anything else from the config.

* Doom modules

This code is written to the =init.el= to select which modules to load. Written here as-is for now, as it is quite well structured and clear.

Install and load some custom local holiday lists I'm interested in.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! holidays
  :after org-agenda
  :config
  (setq calendar-holidays
        (append '((holiday-fixed 1 1 "New Year's Day")
                  (holiday-fixed 2 14 "Valentine's Day")
                  (holiday-fixed 4 1 "April Fools' Day")
                  (holiday-fixed 10 31 "Halloween")
                  (holiday-easter-etc)
                  (holiday-fixed 12 25 "Christmas")
                  (solar-equinoxes-solstices)))))

[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]] provides great grouping and customization features to make agenda mode easier to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-super-agenda)
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-super-agenda
  :after org-agenda

#+end_src

** Org-Roam

Enable Org-Roam and set it's directory.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Sync/org-roam"))
(setq +org-roam-open-buffer-on-find-file t)
#+end_src

*** Org-Roam-UI

[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][Org-Roam-UI]] is a utility built on top of Org-Roam that creates a UI of your Org-Roam graph. These are the recommended defaults for Doom.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(unpin! org-roam)
(package! org-roam-ui)
#+END_SRC

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! websocket
    :after org-roam)

(use-package! org-roam-ui
    :after org-roam ;; :after org
;;         normally we'd recommend hooking orui after org-roam, but since org-roam does not have
;;         a hookable mode anymore, you're advised to pick something yourself
;;         if you don't care about startup time, use
;;  :hook (after-init . org-roam-ui-mode)
    :config
    (setq org-roam-ui-sync-theme t
          org-roam-ui-follow t
          org-roam-ui-update-on-save t
          org-roam-ui-open-on-start t))

*** Vulpea

After coming across Boris Buliga's excellent [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-23-task-management-with-roam-vol1.html][Task management with org-roam series]], I will be implementing many of his concepts into my configuration. A lot of the functionality he makes use of builds on top of [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea][Vulpea]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! vulpea
  :hook ((org-roam-db-autosync-mode . vulpea-db-autosync-enable)))
#+end_src

* Coding

Tangle-on-save has revolutionized my literate programming workflow. It automatically runs =org-babel-tangle= upon saving any org-mode buffer, which means the resulting files will be automatically kept up to date. For a while I did this by manually adding =org-babel-tangle= to the =after-save= hook in Org mode, but now I use the [[https://github.com/yilkalargaw/org-auto-tangle][org-auto-tangle]] package, which does this asynchronously and selectively for each Org file where it is desired.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-auto-tangle)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-auto-tangle
  :defer t
  :hook (org-mode . org-auto-tangle-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-auto-tangle-default t))
#+end_src

* Other tools

** Miscellaneous packages

- [[https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-mode][Dockerfile mode]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! dockerfile-mode)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Dockerfile\\'" . dockerfile-mode))
(put 'dockerfile-image-name 'safe-local-variable #'stringp)
#+end_src

This prevents the =docker= command from producing ANSI sequences during the image build process, which results in a more readable output in the compilation buffer. From https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/55340/11843:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun plain-pipe-for-process () (setq-local process-connection-type nil))
(add-hook 'compilation-mode-hook 'plain-pipe-for-process)
#+end_src

- I find =iedit= absolutely indispensable when coding. In short: when you hit =Ctrl-;=, all occurrences of the symbol under the cursor (or the current selection) are highlighted, and any changes you make on one of them will be automatically applied to all others. It's great for renaming variables in code, but it needs to be used with care, as it has no idea of semantics, it's  a plain string replacement, so it can inadvertently modify unintended parts of the code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! iedit)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! iedit
  :defer
  :config
  (set-face-background 'iedit-occurrence "Magenta")
  :bind
  ("C-;" . iedit-mode))
#+end_src

- A useful macro (sometimes) for timing the execution of things. From [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23622296/emacs-timing-execution-of-function-calls-in-emacs-lisp][StackOverflow]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro zz/measure-time (&rest body)
  "Measure the time it takes to evaluate BODY."
  `(let ((time (current-time)))
     ,@body
     (float-time (time-since time))))
#+end_src
